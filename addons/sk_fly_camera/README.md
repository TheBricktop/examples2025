# Fly Camera Addon for Godot 4

A camera addon for flying around scenes at runtime, which can be handy during the prototyping phase of a project, for example.

The camera is easy to use. You can just drop it in a scene, and run the game. 
Optionally you can also tweek the camera node settings in the inspector (speed, mouse sensitivity, etc). 

By default the camera uses `WASD` keys for movement, `Shift` to move faster, `Ctrl` to move slower, 
and `Right Mouse Button` to activate/deactivate the camera's mouse controls.

Please refer to the documentation for more information.
